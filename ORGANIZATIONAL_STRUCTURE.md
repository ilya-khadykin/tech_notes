## How is this repository organized?
While designing this repository structure I've come up with several rules to save consistency across different topics. 
These rules are listed below.

## Organizational rules
1. Each 'big' topic should have its own sub directory and its own `README.md` with links to all added notes (to simplify context serach by `Ctrl+F`).
1. Code examples should be placed in seperate direcotry called `code_examples`
1. It's expected that you follow [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) notation for names of directories and `*.md` files. 
Code examples should follow language specific guidelines
1. `img` directory should be used to store supplementary images if required
